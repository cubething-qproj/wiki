  title: [PTA worked example: Aristotle on the motion of the earth],
  status: "current",
  summary: [A worked PTA analysis of Aristotle's argument for the earth's natural motion, as quoted by Galileo.],
)

Worked PTA analysis of `pta-test` document `ex03`, on Aristotle’s
reading. The passage is from Finocchiaro’s translation of Galileo.

= Text
#quote(block: true)[
  Who is so blind as not to see that the parts of the element earth and of
  the element water, being heavy bodies, move naturally downwards, namely
  toward the center of the universe, assigned by nature herself as the
  goal and end of straight downward motion… Since this can be seen
  clearly, and since we are sure that the same holds for the whole as for
  the parts, must we not conclude that the natural motion of the \[whole
  globe\] earth is straight toward the center…?
]

= Reading
Aristotle’s, not Galileo’s. "Downwards" means toward the center of
the #emph[universe], and the passage argues that the whole earth moves
there: the geocentric thesis. The website follows Galileo’s critique,
reading "the center" as the center of the earth, which makes the
conclusion incoherent (and drops T2 and T5 below).

= How it was decomposed
Working principles, ours rather than ATIP’s (ATIP types one triad at a
time):

+ Read the author charitably: the reading the author intends.
+ One triad per reason-giving construction ("because", "since",
  "so", "must we not conclude", participles like "being",
  appositions like "namely").
+ A stated generalisation linking two statements is a lever candidate
  before a premise candidate.
+ Every statement that is argued for gets its own triad.
+ Add implicit statements only where a triad can’t be canonicalized
  without them.

  S2["S2 · heavy bodies move downwards<br/>(implicit)"] -- premise --> T1((T1))
  S1["S1 · the parts are heavy bodies"] -- lever --> T1
  T1 -- conclusion --> S3["S3 · the parts move downwards"]
  S3 -- premise --> T2((T2))

  T4 -- conclusion --> S8["S8 · the whole earth moves toward<br/>the center of the universe"]
```

Five triads in one chain: T1 → T2 → T4, with T3 backing T2’s conclusion
and T5 backing T2’s lever. Three levers (S1, S4, S7) are stated in the
text; one of them (S4) is itself argued for.

= Step 2 decisions
- #strong[Rhetorical questions become assertions.] "Who is so blind as
  not to see that q" → q. "Must we not conclude that r" → r.
- #strong[Illocutive markers are stripped.] "we are sure that" is the
  arguer’s stance, not part of S7.
- #strong["downwards" and "toward the center of the universe" are
    kept apart.] Merging them would hide T2, which is the contested step.
- #strong["the whole earth" is universal (u), not singular (s)]: it
  stands for all its parts taken together.

= Triads
```yaml
T1:
  anchor: "being"
  formula: "S3 ∵ S2 [L: S1]"
  canonicalization: >
    the parts of earth and water move naturally downwards
    BECAUSE heavy bodies move naturally downwards
  subjects:
    delta: false
    equal: false

  classification: "β pu G"

    'the parts of earth and water move naturally downwards'
    BECAUSE 'the parts of earth and water belong to the GENUS of heavy bodies'
    AND 'heavy bodies move naturally downwards'
  confidence: medium
  note: >
    The classic syllogism. If read as "all the parts" (u), the substance is uu,
    where GENUS isn't listed: novel.

T2:
  anchor: "namely"
  formula: "S5 ∵ S3 [L: S4]"
  canonicalization: >
    the parts of earth and water move naturally toward the center of the universe
    BECAUSE the parts of earth and water move naturally downwards
  subjects:
    delta: false
    equal: true
    reason: '"the parts of earth and water" == "the parts of earth and water"'
  predicates:
    equal: false
    reason: '"move toward the center of the universe" != "move downwards"'
  form: alpha
  substance: "α FF"
  substance_reason: both predicates are checkable claims about motion
  lever: novel
  lever_statement: S4
  lever_written_out: "Y (moving downwards) is IDENTICAL to X (moving toward the center of the universe)"
  classification: "α FF novel"
  reconstruction: >
    'the parts of earth and water move naturally toward the center of the universe'
    BECAUSE 'moving downwards IS moving toward the center of the universe'
    AND 'the parts of earth and water move naturally downwards'
  confidence: medium
  note: >
    The contested step: it identifies "down" with "toward the center of the
    universe". A definitional lever between two factual predicates; the PTA
    lists DEFINITION only under VF. Either a gap in the table or a step 2
    decision presented as an argument.

T3:
  anchor: "Since" (the first one)
  formula: "S5 ∵ S6"
  canonicalization: >
    that the parts of earth and water move naturally toward the center of the
    universe (q) [is acceptable (A)] BECAUSE q can be seen clearly
  subjects:
    delta: true
    reason: '"this" = S5: the premise is about the claim as a whole'
  form: delta
  substance: "δ II"
  substance_reason: >
    the source of "can be seen clearly" is anyone who looks, including the
    addressee ("who is so blind as not to see"); no listed II lever fits
  lever: novel
  lever_written_out: "Z (being plainly visible) is a PERCEPTUAL GUARANTEE for A"
  classification: "δ II novel"
  confidence: low
  note: >
    An appeal to obviousness. "Who is so blind" also jabs at anyone who denies
    q (ad hominem, δ II H), but that lever concludes U about an opponent's
    view, not A about q.

T4:
  anchor: "must we not conclude"
  formula: "S8 ∵ S5 [L: S7]"
  canonicalization: >
    the whole earth moves naturally toward the center of the universe
    BECAUSE the parts of earth and water move naturally toward the center of the universe
  subjects:
    delta: false
    equal: false
    reason: '"the whole earth" != "the parts of earth and water"'
  predicates:
    equal: true
    reason: '"moves toward the center of the universe" == "move toward the center of the universe"'
  form: beta
  substance: "β uu"
  substance_reason: >
    conclusion: the whole earth as all its parts together (u);
    premise: all the parts (u)
  lever: COMPOSED
  lever_statement: S7
  classification: "β uu Cpo"
  reconstruction: >
    'the whole earth moves naturally toward the center of the universe'
    BECAUSE 'the whole earth is COMPOSED of the parts of earth and water,
    and what holds for the parts holds for the whole'
    AND 'the parts of earth and water move naturally toward the center of the universe'
  confidence: high
  note: >
    S7 states the lever's general principle; the composition fact ("the earth
    is composed of earth and water") is implicit, recorded here rather than
    as a statement. Same type as the website's, on a different reading.

T5:
  anchor: "assigned by"
  formula: "S4 ∵ S9"
  canonicalization: >
    THE PROPOSITION 'downward motion is motion toward the center of the universe' (q)
    [IS ACCEPTABLE (A)] BECAUSE q has been assigned by nature herself
  subjects:
    delta: true
    reason: 'S9 is about S4 as a whole: where the claim comes from'
  form: delta
  substance: "δ III"
  substance_reason: nature is a third party, and the source Aristotle defers to
  lever: EPISTEMICALLY AUTHORITATIVE
  classification: "δ III Exp"
  reconstruction: >
    THE PROPOSITION 'downward motion is motion toward the center of the universe'
    IS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE 'nature is EPISTEMICALLY AUTHORITATIVE about motion'
    AND 'nature herself has assigned it so'
  confidence: medium
  note: >
    Supports T2's lever: the lever recursion the PTA singles out. "Herself"
    marks nature as the source. If Exp is a stretch, novel: "Z is NATURALLY
    AUTHORITATIVE for A". Alternative reading: α FF Cau, nature's assigned goal
    as the final cause of the motion.
